# Thinx-Project

## Description
This is an example of a one-page application created to emulate a specific design request. This page would be an item page for Thinx underwear. Specifically, this page requires the following features:
* static columns on either side; middle column has pictures which scroll down
* text is static except for the "black" and "beige" buttons, which have checkmarks appended to them upon click
* when a user clicks on the "-" or "+" buttons, the quantity of items will change accordingly
* when a user clicks on an image, they will be taken to a gallery page which contains all the larger sized images from the original gallery. 

Here is an example from ssense.com showing the desired functionality of the item page.
